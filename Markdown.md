# Paragraphs

## Various line breaks

There must be some kind of way out of here,  
said a joker to the thief. 

There's so much confusion, I just can't get no relief.

Another paragraph here with really long text. Until I break line in some way, Markdown takes this as one paragraph no matter what.
